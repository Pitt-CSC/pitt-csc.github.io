  bio: "I'm a senior CS major who enjoys web development. When I'm not programming, I'm either rooting for the Patriots, channeling my inner Olivia Pope, agreeing that Jon Snow knows nothing, exercising, drawing, playing video games, or jamming on my bass guitar."

  bio: "I'm a senior CS major who is interested in front-end web development. When I'm not programming I like playing video games (WoW especially), looking at cat pictures, and going to the gym. I'm a dedicated yinzer, so sorry about my Pittsburghese. I'm on slack, twitter, facebook, and check my email obsessively, so if you ever need anything contact me anytime!"
